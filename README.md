    <b>Project Survive</b>
</h1>

A small game made with Unity that I am doing for a University project, and probably after the project is over too (hopefully). 

<b>Overview</b>

My game is a roguelite action game with RPG elements set in a dangerous post apocalyptic world hundreds of years after the ‘doomsday event’. The goal of the game is to make it through a randomly generated world to the ‘safe zone’ where the player will be able to live out their life in peace. Players will have to talk, fight or sneak their way through various situations with NPC characters that will react to previous player choices. 

Death is inevitable in such a dangerous world, and when you die your legacy lives on through your sons, who will continue your quest to the safe zone and maybe even avenge your death and reclaim your stolen gear (revenge mechanic). Player will be able to find new weapons and gear to equip themselves with.

Combat plays a big part of the game, and each character will have (semi) unique abilities that unlock as the player levels up and are randomly assigned on player generation.

Another big part of the game is the dialogue system allowing player to talk with NPC and offer them unique responses. Players can try and talk there way out of a sticky situation, or try and convince people to help the player.
